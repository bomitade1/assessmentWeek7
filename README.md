# 3The method to solve this task is no different than the previous ones, so we start declaring and initializing the necessary variables and classes

#  constructor(){
#       this.X = 0;
#  }
#    
#    money(X){
#        this.X = X;
#    }
#    TimeMachine(year, age) etc

# The requirements say that Ivan is 18 years old, so when declaring the variable years we assign it an initial value of 18. We read the other variables from the console.
#
## Finally, we need to print out the results by checking if the heritage is enough to live without working or not. If the heritage is a positive number, we print: “Yes! He will live a carefree life and will have {N} dollars left.”, and if it is a negative number: “He will need {М} dollars to survive.”.
